# missing-you

It was **THE BASSIST** who told me to keep the GitHub commit status evergreen.

I'm not doing this to slack off. This is just my contingency strategy, extra cover, fail-safe, fallback, final recourse, insurance, last resort, plan Z, precaution, preventive measure, sheet anchor.

And my twisted, perverted love for somebody.

It's really hard for me to let go.
